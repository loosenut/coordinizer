# coordinizer
AutoCAD coordinizer / coordinizinator

The intent of this app is to provide an easy way to create coordinate tables in your AutoCAD sheet files. 
By using the ID or the LIST command, you can quickly produce a series of coordinates in the AutoCAD command 
line window (F2). Copy the results into the text area input box, select your format, and click the submit 
button. Copy and paste the output text into AutoCAD MTEXT. Size appropriately, and explode if desired. 
Note that "Two columns" is the only form of output that allows you to select each column separately, 
which is often useful for putting the output into a table.

It was originally created for appspot, and can be found on coordinizer.appspot.com.

It's also called coordinizator because I had to migrate from coordinizer to a new application after
the Master/Slave datastore was depreciated.
